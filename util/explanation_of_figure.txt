## Visualisation of Embeddings
A 2D PCA projection of relation embeddings on the FB15K-237 dataset. The Figure shows that inverse relations cluster in distant regions.
Note that we applied the standard data augmentation technique.
To generate inverse relations, relations are renamed by adding suffix of inverse as done in (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09590).
